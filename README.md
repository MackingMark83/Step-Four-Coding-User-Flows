# Step-Four-Coding-User-Flows    

    The title of my site is Weather Finder.   https://opening-weather-map-app.herokuapp.com/ 
    
    The website allows any user to find the weather in any city or small town in the world. It will give you the tempature and a small descripition of the weather of the 

city the user selected. While a users uses this site he or she will notice that they can't not add duplicate cities. Also this site forces you to select a real city not a made

up city or town that does not exists. Once a city is selected and added to the page a message will flash leting the user know that it has been added with an delete button. 

A users can then delete the data that was added by clicking the delete button. I choose these features so that it would give the users a smooth flow and also allowing them to 

know their selected city is being created and doesn't fill up the page. As a user enters the page he or she is going to be askes to sign up with a username and a password. After 

the enter that info, they will be directed to a page where they will enter some basic infomation such as first and last name, job descripition, and how you found the website. 

After they do that they will be directed to click a link that will direct them to the weather page where they can select a city they want the weather for. The Api that I used to 

created this website was th Open weather map Api. I used flask, SQLAlchemy, and WTForm as the technology stack to build the website.
